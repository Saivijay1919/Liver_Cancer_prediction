Liver_Cancer_prediction using Machine Learning

Liver is the vital internal organ inside the human body, which eliminates toxics and preserves protein and vitamins.
Liver disorder can cause serious health issues. Most researchers found that machine learning contributes greatly in the early diagnosis of liver disorder.
We have proposed various machine learning methods to predict liver cancer on the basis of clinical dataset provided.
